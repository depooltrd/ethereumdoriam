# DOCUMENTATION
#
# For instructions on setting configs, see http://ethosdistro.com/kb/#remote-config
#
# If using "pool" parameter, write WORKER (a placeholder variable) in place of rig name (i.e. NOT rig1, myrig, home, warehouse2, etc).
#
# pool:			use this if you have a network proxy or to define a getwork pool (example: http://pool.com:port/WORKER )
# stratumproxy:		enabled or disabled, if enabled, you will bypass "pool" and connect to stratum proxy located on this rig
# proxy wallet: 	the ethereum address to which this rig's proxy will mine (only used if stratumproxy is enabled)
# proxypool1:		this rig's stratum proxy's first pool (only used if stratumproxy is enabled)
# proxypool2:		this rig's stratum proxy's failover pool (only used if stratumproxy is enabled)
# flags:		set desired ethminer flags here
# maxgputemp:		the temperature in C that your GPUs will trigger ethminer to turn off
# globalcore:		set the global core clock of all GPUs
# globalmem: 		set the global mem clock of all GPUs
# globalfan: 		set the fan speed percent of all GPUs
# globalpowertune:	set the power tune setting of all GPUs (notes from dev: 20 is default/max on everything except 290/390; r9 290 should use 50)
#
# Your WORKER names are assigned automatically by the OS, do not change them. They are 6-digit alphanumeric codes. 
#
# cor [worker]:	set the core clock of individual GPUs on a single rig, [worker] is the worker/rig name of the single rig as assigned by the OS.
# mem [worker]:	set the core clock of individual GPUs on a single rig, [worker] is the worker/rig name of the single rig as assigend by the OS.
# fan [worker]: set the fan speed of individual GPUs on a single rig, [worker] is the worker/rig name of the single rig as assigend by the OS.
# pwr [worker]: set the powertune of individual GPUs on a single rig, [worker] is the worker/rig name of the single rig as assigend by the OS.
# reb [worker]:	increment this value (example: 4 becomes 5) and the single rig will automatically reboot within 10 minutes.
#
# AUTOMATIC REBOOT NOTES
#
# You are able to reboot remotely. Start with "1" (no quotes) to reboot a rig:
#
# reb a23def 1
#
# Then, if you want to reboot again, increment it to 2, then 3, then 4, etc etc (never skip any numbers).
